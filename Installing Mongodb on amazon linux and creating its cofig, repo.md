first we need to create its repo in 

	/etc/yum.repos.d/
	and that file shoudl be mongodb-org-<version>.repo



and paste the following in this file 


	[mongodb-org-7.0]
	name=MongoDB Repository
	baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/amazon/2023/mongodb-org/7.0/x86_64/
	gpgcheck=1
	enabled=1
	gpgkey=https://pgp.mongodb.com/server-7.0.asc


/etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-7.0.repo

the above is the configuration file that defines the mongodb repository for the `dnf ` package manager in amazon linux. 

This file tells the package manager where to find the mongodb packages and how to verify their authenticity .



#### Explanation of each line 

1. [mongodb-org-7.0]
	This is the name of the repository . It must be unique and is used to identify the repository in the configuration file. 


2.  ** `name=MongoDB Repository` **:

		This is the human readable name of the repository. It is not used by package manager but can be helpful for identifying the repository in lists or logs. 


3. `baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/amazon/2023/mongodb-org/7.0/x86_64/` 

		This is the url of the repository . The package manager will downlaod the package metadata and the packages themselves from this location. 


4. ** `gpgcheck=1` **:

		This option enables GPG (GNU privacy guard) sigunature for the packages. Setting it to 1 ensures that the package manager ensures authenticity of the packages before installing them . 

5. ** `enabled=1` **:

		This option enables the repository . Setting it to 1 means repository is active and will be used by package manager. If you set it to 0 , the repository will be disabled and the package manager will not use it. 


6. ** `gpgkey=https://pgp.mongodb.com/server-7.0.asc` **:


		This is the url of the GPG key used to sign the packages in the repository . The package manager will download this key and use it to verify the sigunature of the packages.
