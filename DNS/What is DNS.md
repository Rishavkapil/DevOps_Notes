The **Domain Name System** is a global system responsible for mapping human-readable hostnames to their corresponding IP addresses. 
For example, if you want to access a website using domain name like example.com , that domain name must point to a valid IP address. 

Multiple Components make up the domain name system , the DNS record types are an important part of the system. 
A DNS resolver does the actual work of finding the correct IP address for the hostname.
