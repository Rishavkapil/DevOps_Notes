**more is the oldest and less is the improved version**

**more :**  forward navigation and limited backward navigation. Earlier more could only scroll down , but now we can use it to scroll up one full screen at a time. 
		`syntax : more <file_name>`
		

**less :** both forward and backward navigation and also has search options. The only reason why less was introduced was to introduce backward movement line by line. 

**most :**  it has all the features of more and less. most allows us to view multiple files simultaneously and switch between them.
