CI CD pipeline is an automated workflow that encompasses steps for continues integration , continues delivery and deployment. 

Continues Integration and Continues Deployment pipeline is a series of steps that must be performed in order to deliver new version of software. 

Used to automate the process


A pipeline is a process that drives software development through path of building , testing and deploying code . 


By automating the process, the objective is to minimize human error and maintain consistent process for how software is released. 


CICD is the way to make software faster, safer and efficient by streamlining and automating process like building , testing and delivery of the software



CICD pipelines are need to improve the efficiency and quality of software delivery.

#### Stages of CICD pipeline

A **CICD**  is a runnable specification of the steps that any developer should perform to deliver a new version of the software .

1. **Source Stage :** 

	In this stage , CICD pipeline is triggered by the code repository. Any changes in the program triggers a notification to  the CI/CD tool that runs an equivalent pipeline. 

2. **Build Stage :** 
	This is the second stage of CI/CD pipeline in which you merge source code and its dependencies. It is mainly done to build  a runnable instance of software that you can potentially ship to end-users. 

3. **Test Stage :** 
	Test Stage includes execution of automated tests to validate the correctness of code and behaviour of the software. 

4. **Deploy Stage :** This is the last stage where your product goes live. Once the build has successfully passed through all the required test scenarios , it is ready to deploy to the live server.
