- Kubernetes Networking addresses four concers : 

- Containers within a pod use network to communicate via loopback. 

- Cluster Network provides communication between different pods. 

- The service resource lets you expose an application running in a pod to be reachable from outside you cluster.


- You can also use services to publish services only for consumption inside your cluster. 


- Container to Container communication on the same pod happens through localhost within container.
