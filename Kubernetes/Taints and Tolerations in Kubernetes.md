## **Taints :**

In Kubernetes, a "Taint" is a key value pair associated with a node that marks the node to repel certain pods. Taints are used to influence the scheduling decisions made by the kubernetes scheduler. When a node is tainted, only pods with matching tolerations can be scheduled onto that node. 

**Key & Lock Formula :** 

Lets use an analogy of key and lock for a house to explain taints and tolerations in Kubernetes. 


Imagine you have a house(which represents a kubernetes node ), and you want to control who an enter and use it.  In this analogy, 

1. **Taints:** Taints act like lock on your house's doors. You can install different types of locks on each door to restrict access. For example, you might have a door that requires a specific key or code to open. Similarly in Kubernetes, taints are applied to nodes to restrict which pods can be scheduled on them. Each taint has a key (the taint itself) that prevent pods without the corresponding toleration from being scheduled on the node. 


2. **Tolerations :** Toleration act like keys that allow certain pods to bypass the locks(taints) and enter the house(node) . When you have a key that matches the lock on the door, you can enter the house without any issues. Similarly, in Kubernetes, pods can specify tolerations that match the taints on nodes. These tolerations act as keys that allow the pods to be scheduled on node despite the taints. 


so in summary, 

* Taints are like locks on the door of your house, restricting access to certain pods(visitors)
* Tolerations are like keys that pods(visitors) can carry to bypass the locks (taints) and be scheduled on nodes. 



**Taint key Concept** 

**Taint Effect :** Determines how the taint affects pod scheduling on the node. 

* **No Schedule:** Pods will not be scheduled onto the tainted node unless they have a matching tolerations. 
* **PreferNoSchedule:** Scheduler tries to avoid scheduling pods onto the tainted node but can do so if necessary. 
* **NoExecute:** Existing pods on the node without matching tolerations are evicted.
