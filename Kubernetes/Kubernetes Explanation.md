Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool 

Why it is needed when we already have docker ?

	self healing , autoscaling , management. 


first , we create pod using ==pod.yml== file 

Now the problem with this is that we can't create replicas with this pod.yml file

So we need do define ==deployment== file , which create replica sets and then replica set creates pods . 


**why do we need services** 

If we have two applications running one for backend and one for frontend . 

Frontend app is forwarding request to Backend using its IP. 

Now everytime the backend app restarts , its IP changes ,
So this is the major problem , it becomes very complicated to change the IP of one service again and again . 

So to solve this issue , we have services. 

In these services , we provide label to Ip's of applications. 


We have two nodes , **Master Node** and **Worker Node** 

**Types of Services :** 

**cluster IP :** can access only within the node
**NodePort :** can access only within EKS or minikube
**ALB :** Can access outside the EKS or minikube (i.e via internet )



But still there is problem with ALB , ALB doesn't provide much configurations (like reverse proxy etc. ) for that we need NGINX or other web servers. 

So kubernetes brings up with Ingress , Ingress is just a file that tells which ingress controller to use like 

in ingress file we have defined .nginx or .alb
