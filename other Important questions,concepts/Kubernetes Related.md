### Where did the logs of the kubernetes cluster get stored ?


==NOTE : HERE WE ARE TAKING EKS CLUSTER AS KUBERNETES CLUSTER==

When you deploy a pod ( via a deployment ) in your EKS cluster , the logs generated by your application inside the application are : 

Stored on the node(i.e EC2 instance or you can say worker node) where the pod is running - not on your local machine. 


#### Here's what happens in detail 

* EKS uses EC2 instances as worker nodes. 
* Each pod runs as a container on one of those EC2 instances. 
* The container runtime (like containerd or docker) stores the logs on the node's local disk. 
* These logs are stored in : 


				/var/log/containers/
				/var/log/pods/
				/var/lib/containerd/... or /var/lib/docker/...


But you can't access them directly unless you ssh into the EC2 instance.
