**Azure Load Balancer and Azure application Gateway** are both load balancing solutions in azure, but they differ significantly in their functionalities and use cases. 

***Azure load balancer*** operates at the Network Transport layer (layer 4), focusing on distributing TCP and UDP traffic efficiently. 

It is suitable for non-HTTP/S based services or simple load balancing scenarios at the TCP/UDP level.

***Azure application gateway*** operates at the application layer(layer 7), providing more advanced routing, load balancing and security features for web applications. 

It can make smart traffic routing decisions based on details in the HTTP requests themselves, such as routing requests to different server pools based on aspects of incoming URLs like path or host headers.
