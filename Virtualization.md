The traditional way a business operates is by having *one machine for one application* 

With virtualization we can run multiple servers on one physical server. 


the software that creates and runs the virtualization is called a **Hypervisor.**



**There are two types of Hypervisor :**


**Type 1(Bare metal) :** Type 1 hypervisor is installed on bare metal hardware, This is installed on empty bare metal hardware. 

Installed directly on the physical hardware
No host OS needed .
High performance and used in data centers. 

**Type 2(Hosted) :** Installed on existing Operating System. 
Easier to setup but slightly slower than type 1 .
