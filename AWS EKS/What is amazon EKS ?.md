Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is the platform for running kubernetes clusters , both in AWS cloud and in your own data centers . 

Amazon EKS simplifies building , securing and maintaining kubernetes clusters. 

Two main approaches of using amazon EKS are as follows : 

* **EKS Standard**: AWS manages the kubernetes control plane when you create a cluster with EKS. Components that manage nodes , schedule workloads , integrate with AWS cloud , and store and scale the control plane information to keep your clusters up and running , are handled for you automatically. 

* **EKS Auto Mode**: Using EKS auto mode feature, EKS extends its control to manage nodes as well.
