Apache  Kafka is a distributed data store optimized for ingesting and processing streaming data in real-time. 

Streaming data is data that is continuously generated by thousands of data sources, which typically send the data records in simultaneously. A Streaming platform needs to handle this constant influx of data, and process the data sequentially and incrementally. 

Kafka provides three main functions to its users : 

* Publish and subscribe to stream of records 
* Effectively store stream of records in the order in which they are generated. 
* Process stream records in real time. 

Kafka is primarily used to build real-time streaming data pipelines and applications that adapt to the data streams. It combines messaging, storage, and stream processing to allow storage and analysis of both historical and real time data.



==***Streams are just infinite data, data that never end. It just keep arriving, and you can process it in real-time.***==
