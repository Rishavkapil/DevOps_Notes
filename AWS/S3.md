***USE CASES OF S3 :*** 
* Backup and storage
* Disaster recovery
* Archive
* Hybrid Cloud Storage
* Application hosting
* Media hosting



### Amazon S3 : Bucket

* Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in buckets(directories).
* Buckets must have globally unique name
* Buckets are defined at region level .



### Amazon S3 : Objects

* Objects (files ) have a key.

*  Metadata (list of text key / value pairs  - system or user metadata)





##### Amazon S3 - Replication (CRR and SRR)

* Must enable versioning in source and destination buckets.
* Cross-Region Replication
* Same-Region Replication
* Buckets can be in different AWS accounts
* Copying is asynchronous
* Must give proper IAM permissions to S3


**Use Cases :** 
*  **CRR :**   Compilance , lower latency access , replication across 
* **SRR :** log aggregation , live replication between production and test account
