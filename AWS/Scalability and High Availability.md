Scalability means that application/system can handle greater loads by adapting. 


**There are two types of Scalability :** 

**Vertical Scalability** 
**Horizontal Scalability** (= Elasticity)


Scalability is linked but different to high Availability. 




#### Vertical Scalability 

It means that we can increase the size of instance . 

For example , your application runs on a t2.micro
Scaling that application vertically means running  it on a t2.large. 



#### Horizontal Scalability 

It means increasing the number of instances / systems for your application . 


## High Availability 

It usually goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling. 


High availability means running your application/ system in at least 2 Availability Zones.
