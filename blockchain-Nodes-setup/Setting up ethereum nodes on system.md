#### What is Ethereum node ?

Ethereum node is a computer that runs ethereum client software and maintains a copy of the blockchain , storing , processing and verifying transactions and blocks. 


There are different types of Ethereum nodes, including full nodes, light nodes, and archive nodes, each with specific roles and data storage requirements.


A full node stores a complete copy of the blockchain and validates every transaction.

while a light node relies on full nodes for transaction validation and only stores a small portion of the blockchain data.

Archive nodes store all historical data and are used for historical queries.
